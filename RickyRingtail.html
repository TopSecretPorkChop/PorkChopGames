<p>Born an orphan down in East LA (due to a freak tragic accident in which both his mother AND father somehow died in childbirth -- Oh, and that's the eastern part of Lower Alabama, BTW), Ricky was thrown to the mercy of the foster system before his first concious memory. Years of neglect left him with strong self-preservation instincts and ample unsupervised free time.</p>
<p>From an early age, Ricky fell in with the wrong crowd. Criminal gangs gave him the sense of belonging he was denied at home, and endowed him with a particular set of skills. Eventually nabbed by the police, Ricky soon found himself incarcerated. Luckily, he had not yet reached his 18th birthday.</p>
<p>Juvenile detention freed Ricky from the ties of his former gang, allowed him to further increase his useful skills, and left him mercifully without a record as his juvenile record was sealed.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, Ricky's release came shortly before the Incident. One day while hiding out in an abandoned building and planning his next move, something strange and unusual happened. Ricky was fighting off a racoon that was bent on carrying off his lunch, when the darn thing bit him. The varmint didn't just give him rabies, though; that would be just tooo lucky for Ricky. It must have been some sort of radioactive raccoon or something, because the next thing Ricky knew he started growing fur and had an irresistable urge to wash his lunch in the nearest stream.</p>

<h1>Stunts</h1>
<details><summary>Ask Around</summary><p>Anyone can ask a question to random people and hope for the best. You make it look less jarring, and can even cover your trail as you do it. Let's get to the bottom of this. To use this action, make a check against the Threat of what you are investigating.<ul>
<li>If you want to hide your presence while doing this, +1 severity.</li>
<li>If you want it to be extra obvious who's doing this, +1 severity. If you don't want to be obvious, but also don't want to take the time/effort to be quiet about it, you could get a -1 severity instead for cutting corners.</li>
<li>This normally takes 1d6 hours, but each +1 Severity halves the time. You can do this after the roll, but then it's +2 Severity per halving.</li></ul></p></details>
<details><summary>Martial Skill: Marksman</summary><p>Firing from a distance is your specialty. While most people suffer +1 Severity per range of distance, you do not.<ul>
<li>Levels in this Stunt work against things that would get in the way of your vision and ranged calculations, like rain, uneven footing, a fast-moving target, etc.</li>
<li>When attacking from range, you can increase the Severity by +4. Succeeding, you hit an especially vulnerable part of the target, inflicting an additional injury.</li>
</ul></p></details>
<details><summary>Mechanical Craft</summary><p>Given the right materials, you can assemble mechanical things great and small. The basic Stunt assumes simple things, like the wheel of a bicycle or a smoothly turning door.<ul>
<li>The Director should set the Threat of whatever object you're attempting to make. You are finished making it when you defeat that obstacle. The time scale of this process is set by the director, with each roll being anywhere from seconds to months depending on what you're up to.</li>
<li>Increase the Severity by +1 to halve the time.  You can do this repeatedly.</li>
<li>A failure wastes time, but you can continue. Failing dramatically loses all progress and some of the materials.</li>
<li>Not having the proper supplies will increase the severity, at the Directorâ€™s discretion.</li></ul></p></details>
<details><summary>Mechanical Repair</summary><p>Assembling mechanical devices is your specialty. The basic Stunt assumes you have all the proper parts pre-made and ready to insert into your new creation. The Severity can and should increase if you have to make up for missing bits and bobs.<ul>
<li>Repairing a bike or malfunctioning oven requires a check against its threat. Mundane common objects under a hundred pounds have a Threat of zero.</li>
<li>You may increase the Severity to get a task done faster, each Severity halving the time.</li>
<li>If the object was outright destroyed instead of broken, increase the Severity by +3, and you may not try again if you fail.</li></ul></p></details>
<details><summary>Stealth<b style="float:right;margin-right:1rem;">SECRET</b></summary><p>Sometimes it's best not to be seen. Roll this only if you are trying not to be seen by someone with a Threat level or if you don't have this stunt. One secret roll should be performed by the GM, and compared to those who might spot you as they come into potential sensing of you. Performing an action against an unwilling target ruins your stealth unless you take a +1 Severity on that roll.<ul>
<li>Want to hide your friends too? Add +1 severity. Don't blame us if they make noise later though.</li>
<li>If your target is using senses you don't have (like a keen sense of smell perhaps, or infrared cameras), add +1 severity.</li></ul></p></details>
<hr>
<h1>Ancestry Feats</h1>
<details><summary>Natural Climber</summary><p>Sticky pads, prehensile tail, or some other natural part makes you better than most at climbing, lowering all such checks by -1 severity.</p></details>
<details><summary>Twitchy Ears</summary><p>Your ears turn left and right, and possibly up and down and maybe behind you? They're on the watch! Any
check you make regarding sounds, especially ones coming from unexpected places, are at -1 severity.</p></details>
<h1>Profession Feats</h1>
<details><summary>Handyperson</summary><p>Given a wrench and a screwdriver, you can do amazing things to marvel your friends, clients, and maybe your enemies? No time for that, this won't build itself. You gain the <b>Mechanical Craft Stunt</b> and <b>Mechanical Repair Stunt</b>.</p></details>
<details><summary>Spy</summary><p>You are a master of not being noticed. You begin with the <b>Stealth Stunt</b> and the <b>Ask Around Stunt</b>. Now shoo, I don't need you drawing attention to me.</p></details>
<h1>Goal Feats</h1>
<details><summary>Criminal (Espionage)</summary><p>Some people want to win in the system, you don't. Either because you don't feel you can, or you're convinced it's easier outside, or some other reason, crime is your calling and how you plan to make it work. Select a kind of crime (larceny, stock fraud, work with your Director) and enjoy a -1 Severity when making attempts of this related nature.</p></details>
